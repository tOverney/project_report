==============


to see the midterm presentation slideshow [go to this link](http://toverney.github.io/project_report/sliderust-master/)


/!\ if you want to add only part of your changes, don't use super_commit, as it adds everything /!\

if you make any changes to the sildeshow, please use `./super_commit.sh your_commit_message`
instead of `git commit . -m your_commit_message` & `git push origin master`

This way it also update the online slideshow instead of just updating the master.
